/**
 *  \brief
 *	This macro creates a composite state with a single region, including its 
 *	own initial pseudostate, history (shallow and deep type) pseudostate, as 
 *	well as its own final state.
 *
 *	The names of history pseudostate and final state are internally conformed 
 *	as "<nameOfCompositeState>Hist" and "<nameOfCompositeState>Final" 
 *	respectively. Thus, use these names as target vertex in a transition. 
 *
 *	Shallow history means that history applies to the current nesting context
 *	only – states nested more deeply are not affected by the presence of a
 *	history pseudostates in a higher context.
 *	Deep history applies downwards to all levels of nesting.
 *
 *  \param[in] name     state name. Represents a composite state structure.
 *  \param[in] en       pointer to state entry action. This argument is

 *                      The RKH implementation preserves the transition sequence
 *                      imposed by Harel's Statechart and UML.

 *                      pointer to initial transition action of the composite 
 *                      state's region. This argument is optional, thus it 
 *                      could be declared as NULL. The RKH implementation 
 *                      preserves the transition sequence imposed by UML.

/**

 *  The conditional pseudostates are semantic-free vertices that are used to

 *  transition paths between states. For example, a junction can be used to
 *  converge multiple incoming transitions into a single outgoing transition
 *  representing a shared transition path (this is known as a merge).
 *  Conversely, they can be used to split an incoming transition into multiple
 *  outgoing transition segments with different guard conditions. This
 *  realizes a static conditional branch. (In the latter case, outgoing
 *  transitions whose guard conditions evaluate to false are disabled. A
 *  predefined guard denoted "ELSE" may be defined for at most one outgoing
 *  transition. This transition is enabled if all the guards labeling the
 *  other transitions are false.) Static conditional branches are distinct
 *  from dynamic conditional branches that are realized by choice vertices.

/**
 *  \brief
 *	This macro creates a submachine state.
 *
 *  A submachine state is a kind of a state that actually refers to
 *  another defined state machine.
 *  A submachine state is logically equivalent to the insertion of the
 *  referenced state machine as a composite state in the place of
 *  the submachine state. Consequently, every entrance to a submachine
 *  state is equivalent to the corresponding entrance to the inserted
 *  (referenced) composite state. In particular, it can be entered
 *  thruough its initial pseudostate (as any other composite state), or
 *  through one of its entry points.
 *
 *  Similary, every exit from a submachine state is equivalent to the
 *  corresponding exit from the inserted composite state. It can be exited
 *  through one of its exit points. When it is exited through its exit point
 *  the effect of the transition targeting the exit point is executed first,
 *  followed by the exit behavior of the composite state.
 *
 *  The purpose od defining submachine states is to decompose and localize
 *  repetitive parts because the same state machine can be referenced from
 *  more than one submachine state.

 *	Initializes the parameters (attibutes) of a basic state object.
 *
 *	By means of single inheritance in C it could be used to associate data

 *
 *	(1)  Defines MENU_ST_T as a derived structure from the basic state
 *		 structure. It could be used to associate data to a basic state
 *		 objects. \n
 *	(2)	 Implementing the single inheritance in C is very simply by literally
 *		 embedding the base type, RKH_SBSC_T in this case, as the first

 *	(4)	 Declares the transtion table by means of RKH_DECLARE_TR_TBL() macro
 *		 provided by the framework. \n
 *	(6)  Instantiates the derived state structure. \n
 *	(7)  Initializes the base structure, basic state in this case, using the
 *		 RKH_INIT_BASIC_STATE() macro provided by the framework. \n
 *	(8)  Initializes the private member of derived state. \n
 *	(9)  Invokes the BLINKY_BASIC_STATE() macro to instantiate the
 *		 derived state object, menu_cfg. Note that the "Menu 1" string is
 *		 associated to the state machine context, menu_cfg state in this
 *		 case. \n
 *	(10) Lastly, on the transtion action mc_title(), or any other action, is
 *		 used the state data after casting the active object state to
 *		 derived state object.
 *
 *  The following listing shows another example for derived state structure,
 *  which access to RAM from ROM object (state structure).
 *

 *  the effect of the transition targeting the exit point is executed first,
 *  followed by the exit behavior of the composite state.
 *
 *  The entry, exit, and behavior actions and internal transitions are
 *  defined as part of the state. Submachine state is a decomposition
 *  mechanism that allows factoring of common behaviors and their reuse.
 *
 *  The purpose od defining submachine states is to decompose and localize
 *  repetitive parts because the same state machine can be referenced from
 *  more than one submachine state.
 *
 *	The diagram in following figure shows a fragment from a state machine
 *	diagram in which a submachine state (the \c SB) is referenced.
 *
 *	\anchor fig_sbm1
 *	\image html sbm1.png "Submachine state"
 *
 *	In the above example, the transition triggered by event \c TWO will
 *	terminate on entry point \c ENS12 of the \c SB state machine.
 *	The \c ONE transition implies taking of the default transition of the
 *	\c SB and executes the \c act5() action. The transition emanating from
 *	the \c EX1S12 exit point of the submachine will execute the \c act1()
 *	behavior in addition to what is executed within the \c SB state machine.
 *	Idem transition emanating from the \c EX2S12.
 *	This transition must have been triggered within the \c SB state machine.
 *	Finally, the transition emanating from the edge of the submachine state
 *	is triggered by event \c THREE.
 *
 *	The following figure is an example of a state machine \c SB defined with
 *	two exit points, \c EXPNT1 and \c EXPNT2, and one entry point \c ENPNT.

 *  point"
 *
 *	In the following figure the state machine shown above is referenced twice in
 *	a submachine state \c S12 and \c S2.

/**
 *  \brief
 *	Executes a state machine in a run-to-completation (RTC) model.
 *
 *	In this model, before the system handles a new event it can store it
 *	until the previous event has completed processing. This model is
 *	called run to completion or RTC. Thus, the system processes events in
 *	discrete, indivisible RTC steps. An RTC step is the period of time in
 *	which events are accepted and acted upon. Processing an event always
 *	completes within a single model step, including exiting the source
 *	state, executing any associated actions, and entering the target state.
 *  The RKH implementation preserves the transition sequence imposed by
 *  Harel's Statechart and UML. Specifically, the implemented transition
 *  sequence is as follows:
 *
 *  - Execute exit actions of the source state.
 *  - Execute the transition actions.
 *  - Execute entry actions of the target state.
 *
 *  Here now are the details of the main part of this algorithm
 *  (rkh_sm_dispatch()), in which an event is processed by the statechart.
 *
 *  \li	Determine the compound transition (CT) that will fire in response
 *      to the event: traverse the states in the active configuration from
 *      lowest states in the hierarchy upwards. A CT is enabled if its
 *      trigger is the dispatched event, and the guard evaluates to true.
 *      Once an enabled transition is found with a given source state stop
 *      traversing the states that are higher than this state in the
 *      hierarchy.
 *  \li	Perform the CT that we found should fire.
 *      For each transition do:
 *      -	Update histories of exited states.
 *      -   Perform the exit actions of the exited states according to the
 *          order states are exited, from low state to high state.
 *      -	Perform the actions on the CT sequentially according to the
 *          order in which they are written on the transition, from the
 *          action closest to source state to the action closest to target
 *          state.
 *      -	Perform the entry actions of the entered states according to
 *          the order states are entered, from high state to low state.
 *      -	For lowest level states that were entered, which are not basic
 *          states, perform default transitions (recursively) until the
 *          statechart reaches basic states.
 *      -	Update the active configuration.
 *  \li	Wrap up: once a stable configuration is reached, the reaction to the
 *      event is completed, control returns to the dispatcher and new events
 *      can be dispatched.
