<EM> "A behavioral description of a system specifies dynamic aspects of the
entire system or of a particular function, including control and timming.
It specifies the states and modes that the system might reside in and
the transitions between them. It also describes what causes activities
to start and stop, and the way the system reacts to various events.
A natural technique for describing the dynamic of a system is to use
a finite state machine. The described system of function is always
in one of a finite set of states. When an event occurrs, the system
reacts by performing actions. The events causing the reaction are called
triggers."

\section Overview Overview

RKH is a generic, flexible, modular, highly portable, ANSI-C compliant, 
and open-source development tool for implementing hierarchical 
state machines based on modern state machine concepts. This modern 
techniques are used to give an abstract description of the dynamic 
behavior of a system in a substantial manner. RKH is built based on 
platform-independent modules which is shown in the following figure.

<STRONG> The key features of the RKH framework: </STRONG>

- State machines representation is based on state tables.
- Representing a state machine with RKH is intuitive, and easy.
- Reflects the state diagram without obfuscation.
- The RKH application are highly maintainable.
- Easy to integrate with any event queuing and dispatching mechanism.
- Useful in embedded systems.
- The most of the RKH implementation is \ref Porting "independent of any particular CPU, operating system, or compiler".
- Flexible and \ref cfg "user-configurable code generation".
- Very small footprint.
- Include a \link rkhfwk_sched.h dispatching event mechanism \endlink based on active object's priority.
- Include a \link rkhqueue.h queue module \endlink
- Include a \link rkhtmr.h software timer module \endlink.
- Include a \link rkhmempool.h fixed-size memory block module \endlink.
- Include a native \ref dbg.
- Support hierarchically nested states, and flat state machine.
- Support multiple state machines.
- Support conditional, choice, and history pseudostates.
- Support compound transitions with guards.
- Support \link RKH_SSBM_T submachine state\endlink.
- Support local transitions.
- Support the entry and exit actions.
- Implement the traditional transition sequence.
- Include mechanism for \link rkh_sma_defer() deferring events\endlink.
- Support \link RKH_EVT_T event dispatching with parameters\endlink.
- Include \link RKH_EVT_T dynamic events\endlink.
- Support a easy way to use \link RKH_EVT_T events with arguments\endlink.
- Support systems-friendly \link RKH_ASSERT() assertion\endlink macros like assert, allege, error, require, and ensure.

<STRONG> Structure </STRONG>

As shown in the diagram below, the RKH framework has a layered structure.

\section Purpose Purpose and inspiration

For many years, I had been used the traditional state machine concepts
based on state table strategy for modeling the dynamic behavior of several 
reactive-systems, in many industries. Over the years, this implementation
was expanding its abilities to support system requirements increasingly 
complex, achieving hierarchically nested states, pseudostates, compound
transitions, and more, proposed by Harel Statecharts.

The RKH not implements neither entire UML specs. nor entire Statechart specs.
Instead, the RKH intention is to support just enough basic concepts of that
powerful tools to facilitate the reactive-system modeling holding a solid,
and efficient implementation. Broadly speaking, the RKH implementation has
been designed from the ground up to be used in 8-bits platforms but can be
easily adapted to 16 or 32-bits platforms.
